/// Renders a [core.ImageNode] as a Flutter [Image].
///
/// An image that fails to load keeps the declared size instead of throwing, so
/// a broken source never breaks the surrounding layout. The [core.ImageNode.alt]
/// text is exposed as the semantic label for screen readers.
///
/// The fit is always passed, even when the node names none: the renderer would
/// otherwise leave the question to `Image`, whose answer is its own, while the
/// web renderer would leave it to the browser's `object-fit: fill`.
///
/// The responsive fields of the node — [core.ImageNode.srcSet],
/// [core.ImageNode.sizes], [core.ImageNode.loading] and
/// [core.ImageNode.fetchPriority] — are not read here. Flutter loads one source,
/// so [core.ImageNode.src] is what a device gets; the web renderer writes the four
/// as `<img>` attributes. This is a deliberate difference between the two
/// renderings, recorded in both READMEs: a candidate list is a web optimisation
/// and a model cannot ask Skia to pick from it.
